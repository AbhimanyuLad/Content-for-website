## Introduction

Chess has long been recognized as the ultimate testbed for artificial intelligence, offering 
a rich blend of strategy, decision-making, and logical reasoning. From early rule-based 
engines to today’s advanced neural networks, the pursuit of building machines that can 
play chess at a high level continues to drive innovation in computer science and AI 
research. With the rise of generative AI models, particularly large language models 
(LLMs) like Gemini AI by Google, new opportunities have emerged to develop intelligent, 
language-aware agents capable of understanding game context and responding 
strategically. This project explores that potential by implementing a web-based Chess 
Agent that uses Gemini AI to play against a human user. 
The system architecture is divided into two core components: a React frontend and a 
Spring Boot backend. When the user lands on the home page, they are first prompted to 
configure the match — setting parameters like timers and preferences. Once the game 
starts, the interface displays a fully interactive chessboard along with a game clock. The 
user makes the first move, which is then logged and displayed in the move history panel 
for clarity and reference. 
After each move, the frontend sends the updated move history to the backend. The 
Spring Boot backend then plays a critical role — it constructs a dynamic natural language 
prompt that describes the current game situation and sends it to the Gemini AI agent via 
an API. Gemini interprets the prompt, processes the board state, and generates an 
intelligent move suggestion, returned in UCI (Universal Chess Interface) format. This 
format is widely accepted in chess engines and makes it easy to parse and execute 
moves programmatically. The UCI move is then forwarded to the frontend, which 
updates the board and continues the game seamlessly. 
What makes this project unique is the use of generative AI instead of traditional chess 
engines like Stockfish. Gemini doesn't rely solely on hard-coded evaluation functions or 
brute-force search algorithms; instead, it interprets game state through the lens of 
natural language understanding and strategic reasoning. This allows the AI to offer a 
more human-like, context-aware playing experience, making the match feel dynamic 
and unpredictable. 
This project demonstrates how modern AI models can be integrated into web 
applications to create engaging, intelligent user experiences. By bridging frontend 
interactivity with backend logic and AI-driven decision-making, the system represents a 
practical and innovative use of current technologies. It also opens the door for future 
1 
enhancements, such as voice-based interaction, adaptive difficulty, or real-time 
commentary generated by AI.
## Purpose of the work

The purpose of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a generative AI agent in playing a structured board game like chess. By integrating Google’s Gemini AI with a web- based chess platform, the project seeks to test the feasibility of using large language models to interpret game history and generate valid chess moves in UCI format. This serves as a step toward blending natural language understanding with strict rule-based
systems, offering new insights into AI applications in recreational and educational tools.

## Architecture Overview

Here's a breakdown of the core structure:

- `Spring Boot Backend` — Handles game state, move validation
- `Gemini API` — Offers extra move suggestions (for learning/analysis)

## Objectives

a) Aim- To design and implement an intelligent chess agent that uses Google’s Gemini AI to generate real-time, UCI-compliant chess moves within a web-based platform, enabling users to play against a human-like AI opponent.

b) Objectives-
1. Develop a responsive React-based frontend that displays a chessboard, timer,

and move history.
2. Implement a Spring Boot backend to manage the communication between the
frontend and Gemini AI.
3. Design a prompt-generation system that converts user move history into
meaningful input for the Gemini API.
4. Use Gemini AI to analyse the game state and generate a legal UCI-standard move.
5. Validate and forward AI-generated moves to the frontend in real time.
6. Ensure compliance with standard chess rules throughout the game.
7. Evaluate the performance of the AI in terms of response time, accuracy, and user
experience.

## Code Snippet: Launching Stockfish

```java
ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("stockfish");
Process engine = pb.start();
BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(engine.getOutputStream()));
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(engine.getInputStream()));
